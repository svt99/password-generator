# password-generator
https://svt99.github.io/password-generator/

for this assinment i created a password generator so it prompts things to the user then the code randomizes a pw depending on what type of characters the user want in their pw, the password is then displayed in the page. It was a very challenging assignment due to having to use for loops and math.random. I had to use a tutor to help me get started, after i kind of figured it out after hours of tinkering with the code.
